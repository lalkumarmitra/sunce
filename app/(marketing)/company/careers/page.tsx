                                We do things a little different at Sunce starting with where we work. Our consultants work remote. We don&apos;t believe in a big office with more overhead. We&apos;ve reimagined how we work. We collaborate using simple tools, not overly complex. We&apos;ve reinvented who is on our team by focusing on a diverse group of talented contract consultants to work on projects they enjoy. We&apos;ve changed up when we work. Burn out stinks. We are flexible and focus on engagements with awesome clients!
